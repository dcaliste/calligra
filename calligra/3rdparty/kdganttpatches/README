This directory contains patches to KDGantt.  The reason is that we
want to be able to reapply them to the next version of KDGantt when we
upgrade to the next version.

Patches:

inline_span_destructor.diff
  This patch makes Span::~Span() destructor inline, this way matching all other
  methods of Span and thus allowing other libs to use the class even though no
  symbols are exported
