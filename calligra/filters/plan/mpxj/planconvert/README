PlanConvert
-----------

PlanConvert converts some project file formats into Calligra Plan file format.
It is written in Java and uses MPXJ for reading other file formats, see:
http://mpxj.sourceforge.net

This means that PlanConvert *should* be able to convert from all the file formats MPXJ supports.
However, so far (April, 2012) only Planner (*.planner) and MS project file formats *.mpx and *.mpp has been tested.

PlanConverts classes is generated from the plan.dtd file using the script: generatedtdclasses
There is a copy in subdirectory ./dtd.
The original is found in the main plan project.


Making changes to PlanConvert
----------------------------

If changes are done to the original dtd that impacts PlanConvert, the following must be done:
1) Copy original to ./dtd
2) Generate new PlanConvert schema classes using the bash script generatedtdclasses
3) Update the PlanWriter class to correctly call the new schema classes
4) Install mpxj and modify build.xml to point to it, or make a link (mpxj) to it.
5) Compile the modifications using ant (ant jar)
6) Install (from your cmake build directory)


Running
-------
When run as an import filter, java needs to know how to locate the mpxj and Apache POI jar files.
If theses are not installed in a place where Java finds them, you will have to point to them using
the PLAN_CLASSPATH environment variable, e.g:

$ PLAN_CLASSPATH=/path/to/mpxj/mpxj.jar:/path/to/poi/poi.jar calligraplan&
