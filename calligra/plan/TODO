Some useful stuff:              
You can search the source code for FIXME and TODO entries with:
find . -name "*.c*" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -E "(###|TODO|FIXME|todo)"

Using -A and -B with grep gives you some additional context around the particular comment:
find . -name "*.c*" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -A 3 -B 3 -E "(###|TODO|FIXME|todo)"
